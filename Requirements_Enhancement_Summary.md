## Specific Corrections

### Original Issues Fixed:

1. **Incomplete Requirements**: Original document had brief bullet points. Now each requirement has full description, priority, and details.

2. **Missing Context**: Added business context, assumptions, and constraints.

3. **No Non-Functional Requirements**: Added comprehensive NFR section covering performance, security, usability, reliability, compatibility, and maintainability.

4. **Unclear Order Workflow**: Clarified the 5-stage order workflow with automatic completion logic.

5. **Vague RBAC Description**: Expanded to detailed role and permission management with granular permissions.

6. **Missing Research Details**: Expanded research topics with specific questions and investigation areas.

7. **No Architecture Information**: Added system architecture section with technology recommendations.

8. **Incomplete Data Model**: Added data requirements section with entity definitions.

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Have stakeholders review the document
2. **Design Phase**: Use requirements to create:
   - Use case diagrams
   - Entity relationship diagrams
   - System architecture diagrams
   - UI/UX mockups
3. **Implementation**: Use requirements as basis for development
4. **Testing**: Use requirements for test case creation
5. **Maintenance**: Update requirements as system evolves
